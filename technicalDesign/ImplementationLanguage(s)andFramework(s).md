- #### The language chosen is Java. The reasoning behind selecting this language is:
	- All of the group members have prior experience coding and creating programs in Java
   	- Java has many tools and libraries to aid in the development process
	- Java is not platform-specific; therefore, the code can be run across many platforms.
   #### [About Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html):
  The programming language Java emerged in 1995 from Sun Microsystems. Java has grown to be one of the most commonly used languages. It is known to be reliable, which is why many well-known and trusted companies use the language. To ensure their application is accessible to all, many versions of Java can be used on any operating system. There are plenty of resources on their website, including answers to commonly asked questions and explanations of different errors that can occur. In recent times, the Java language has been run by the company Oracle. Oracle is considered one of the top development platforms. They have an online academy in which they teach the Java language and help programmers get certified. There are many resources provided to ensure a successful use of Java.
