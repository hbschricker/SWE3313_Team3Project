  The programming language Java emerged in 1995 from Sun Microsystems. Java has grown to be one of the most commonly used languages. It is known to be reliable, which is why many well-known and trusted companies use the language. To ensure their application is accesible to all, there are many versions of Java that are able to be used on any operating system.
