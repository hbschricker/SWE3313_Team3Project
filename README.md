# SWE3313_Databaes
Welcome to the official Databaes class project repository for SWE 3313! Within this repository is our project documentation, source code, and presentation material for our project.

The Databaes's online store offers handcrafted jewelry products made from recycled materials. Our mission is to provide a user-friendly platform that showcases our special products while promoting sustainability. For our application, we are building an e-commerce website using Java and Spring Initializr to sell our handcrafted jewelry items.

Thank you for viewing our work!
